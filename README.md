# i8086

An experimental Intel 8086 emulator made in 2018 for self-educational purposes.

## Features:

- Config files to set the registers' initial values and file-to-memory mappings (with write protect support).
- Execution until `hlt` is encountered

## TODO:
- A way to do console IO using ports
- ~~A method to map IO ports to something~~
- 8087 support (?)

## Disclaimer:

This emulator must not yet be used for practical purposes, as it is still untested.
